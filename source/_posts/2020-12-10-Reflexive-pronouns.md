We use reflexive pronouns when the subject and the object are the same person or thing.

*e.g. Linda enjoyed herself in the park.*

*Linda's parents will go and see the photos for themselves.*

|                   |Singular|Plural    |
|:------------------|:-------|:---------|
|                   |myself  |ourselves |
|                   |yourself|yourselves|
|Reflexive pronouns |himself |themselves|
|                   |herself |themselves|
|	                |itself  |themselves|

We can form comparative and superlative adverbs in the same way we form comparative and superlative adjectives.

Millie came third in the race. She ran fast.
Sandy came second in the race. She ran faster than Millie.
Amy came first in the race. She ran the fastest
We form comparative and superlative adverbs like this:

|Adverb                    |Comparative                      |Superlative                    |
|:-------------------------|:--------------------------------|:------------------------------|
|***Most short adverbs***  |+ er                             |+ est                          |
|*e.g. hard / high*        |*harder / higher*                |*hardest / highest*            |
|Long adverbs              |more +                           |most +                         |
|*e.g. quickly / carefully*|*more quickly* / *more carefully*|*most quickly / most carefully*|
|Irregular adverbs         |replace the word|replace the word|                               | 
|*e.g. well/badly/far*     |*better / worse /further*        |*best / worst / furthest*      |

The following adverbs have the same form as the adjectives:
**early, far, fast, hard, high, late, long, near**
